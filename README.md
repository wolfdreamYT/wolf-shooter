# How To Use:

  To start, please visit `wolfdreamyt.github.io/wolf-shooter`

  Now, to walk/move, you can use WASD:
    - W to walk forward
    - A to walk to the left
    - S to walk backwards
    - D to walk to the right

  Now, to shoot, you can use left click (clicking without using control)

  Now, to sprint, press CONTROL/right click once while holding down W to sprint
  
Sprinting only lasts for 10 seconds, and once the player is tired, they will stop sprinting and walk normally, until sprint has come back. This will be used as a quick escape method if the AIs are too strong at the moment, though not used for long distance running.

Now, to open shop, press B and a UI should appear. This UI will have 2 buttons: Ammo and health. You can click one or the other to get more of that item. Please remember that when you click a button, you might need to press ESCAPE to unlock the mouse as the mouse locking system on java is a bit weird. Remember to kill AIs for their ammo and points. Each kill earns 100 points, and each kill gives you your ammo back, so 1 bullet every kill you obtain.

Now, to open the BattlePass, you must click P on your keyboard. This will open a nice BattlePass UI with your level, and progress to the next level. Each level gives better rewards, and comes with both ammo and points for purchasing items in shop and killing more enemies. The BattlePass contains 10 predefined levels with rewards getting better as you go on, and after reaching level 10, your level stops increasing and every 1000 points (10 kills) after will give you 10 more ammo.

This map is a never ending map. There are chunks of 32x32 and you can go anywhere you want. Infinite amount of enemies will spawn, about 1-2 per chunk, and walls, floor, and obstacles will generate for you to hide behind, but be careful! Enemies can now go through walls and obstacles, since the gamemode is on HardCore now! But, you can use the boxes and walls as cover for bullets, as bullets cannot travel through solid objects! Have fun, and try to survive as much as possible!

TIP: For version 4.0, i decided to add chunk loading system where when you move away from a chunk, it despawns, and generates new ones according to the player position. This makes your gameplay smoother and easier to use, especially for low-end users with not that much RAM & CPU.

Thankyou for supporting this project, and this is going to get better as we progress. Please, if you havent laready, give us a good star rating. If you do not like or have not been satisfied from our work, please let us know as this can help us improve the game better.
