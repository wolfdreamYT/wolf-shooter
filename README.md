# How To Use:

  To start, please visit [link unavailable]

  Now, to walk/move, you can use WASD:
    - W to walk forward
    - A to walk to the left
    - S to walk backwards
    - D to walk to the right

  Now, to shoot, you can use left click (clicking without using control)

  Now, to sprint, press CONTROL/right click once while holding down W to sprint
  
Sprinting only lasts for 10 seconds, and once the player is tired, they will stop sprinting and walk normally, until sprint has come back. This will be used as a quick escape method if the AIs are too strong at the moment, though not used for long distance running.

Now, to open shop, press B and a UI should appear. This UI will have 2 buttons: Ammo and health. You can click one or the other to get more of that item. Please remember that when you click a button, you might need to press ESCAPE to unlock the mouse as the mouse locking system on java is a bit weird. Remember to kill AIs for their ammo and points. Each kill earns 100 points, and each kill gives you your ammo back, so 1 bullet every kill you obtain.
